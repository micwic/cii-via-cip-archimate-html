						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">The evolution of the number of residential charging stations in Switzerland over the next 10 years is expected to grow exponentially, mainly due to the following factors:
* Increased sales of electric vehicles (EVs): Switzerland is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, which implies massive electrification of the car fleet. Sales of EVs are therefore expected to increase considerably in the coming years, leading to increased demand for residential charging stations.
* Government incentives: The Swiss government has put in place various incentives to encourage the adoption of EVs, including subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles and the installation of charging stations. These measures should stimulate demand for residential charging stations.
* Development of public charging infrastructure: The development of the public charging network is also a key factor in encouraging the adoption of EVs. The more public charging stations available, the more confident drivers will be in their ability to charge their vehicles, which will stimulate demand for residential charging stations.
* Increasing awareness of environmental issues: Increasing awareness of environmental and climate issues is driving more and more citizens to adopt more sustainable modes of transport, such as electric vehicles. This trend is also expected to contribute to the growth of the residential charging station market.
* Technological innovation: Technological advances in charging stations, particularly in terms of charging power, connectivity and ease of use, should also make such equipment more attractive to individuals.
Forecasts:
It is difficult to give precise figures, but several studies predict a 10-fold or even 20-fold increase in the number of residential charging stations in Switzerland by 2030. According to some estimates, the number of bollards could thus increase from a few tens of thousands today to several hundreds of thousands, or even a million, by the end of the decade.
Challenges to be met:
* Adaptation of the electricity grid: The massive increase in the number of residential charging stations will require an adaptation of the electricity grid to meet the increased demand for electricity.
* Access to housing: For tenants, access to a residential charging station can be a challenge, as it requires the consent of the owner and installation work.
* Cost: The cost of purchasing and installing a residential charging station may be a brake for some households.
Despite these challenges, the growth of the residential charging market in Switzerland seems inevitable in the coming years, given current trends and government policies in favour of electromobility.
